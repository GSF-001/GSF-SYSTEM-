# GSF

A self-sustaining digital system for coordination, reputation, and automated incentives.  
No custody. No financial advice. No central control over user funds.

GSF is an experiment in building digital infrastructure that can operate with minimal human intervention.

---

## What This Is

GSF is not a product.  
It is a **system architecture**.

A set of modules that coordinate:

- identity  
- reputation  
- incentives  
- governance  
- automation  

across distributed communities.

Money moves only through external brokers.  
GSF only moves **signals, rules, and coordination logic**.

---

## Why

Most platforms fail because:

- trust is centralized  
- incentives are manual  
- governance is opaque  
- operators become single points of failure  

GSF removes these failure modes by design.

---

## Core Properties

- No custody of user funds  
- Algorithmic governance  
- Automated reward & penalty loops  
- Reputation without financial control  
- Systems that continue running when operators go offline

## Modules

See:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- `MODULES.md`  

All modules are optional.  
All modules are replaceable.

---

## Status

Experimental.

This repository documents a working architecture for:

- autonomous operations  
- decentralized trust signals  
- automated community coordination  

Not production-ready.  
Not financial advice.  
Use at your own risk.

---

## Usage

This system is intended for:

- builders of coordination protocols  
- designers of incentive mechanisms  
- developers exploring autonomous platforms  
- communities that want systems to outlive their operators  

---

## Notes

GSF does not promise profit.  
GSF only defines mechanisms.

If the mechanisms work,  
the system survives.

If they do not,  
the system fails — visibly.
